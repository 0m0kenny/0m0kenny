# Welcome to my world!

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kenny Oyesola. Iâ€™m interested in software development for bioinformatics, data analysis, AI and machine learning.


I am currently pursuing an MSc in Bioinformatics at the University of Birmingham, I have collaborated with colleagues to design and deploy a reproducible computational pipeline using Nextflow called the [HazExplorer2.0](https://github.com/0m0kenny/oak) â€”a pipeline for analysing methylation states and for calling genetic variants from WGBS data. This involved extensive data processing, quality control, and downstream interpretation of SNP and methylation data across diverse tree populations.

I created some tutorials on analysing VCF files in R called [VCF_Analysis_R](https://github.com/0m0kenny/VCF_Analysis_R).

I also participated in the [HealthTech AI Hub's Hackathon](https://www.linkedin.com/company/healthtech-ai-hub/) where I co-developed [SuperQA].(https://github.com/Eileenyuu/SuperQA), an AI-powered literature review assistant that leverages GPT-4o, Milvus, and a Flask frontend to query, evaluate, and test large biomedical datasets. 

Previously, while completing a short course at the University of Manchester, I built [Variant_Annotator](https://github.com/0m0kenny/Variant_Annotator), a Python-based application using Ensemblâ€™s VEP API to automate annotation of genomic variants.
